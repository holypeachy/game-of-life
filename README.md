# ðŸ§¬ Conway's Game of Life
#### I learned about Raylib for C# and decided to code up Conway's Game of Life. This is probably one of my favorite projects.
- Grid loops around in all directions.
- Save and load grid state.
- Can pause at any moment and advance by one generation.
- Grid size and tick rate can be changed by altering a few variables.

## âœ… Possible Improvements
- Make it so the user can hold and drag to flip cells
- Make the window auto-resize with the grid

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/raylib-cs/raylib-cs)
- .NET 6

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
```bash
git clone git@github.com:holypeachy/game-of-life.git
cd game-of-life
dotnet run
```
If raylib is missing add the package using:
```bash
dotnet add package Raylib-cs
```
